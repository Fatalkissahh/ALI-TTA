          We have been a wholesale plain t-shirt supplier for 25 years supplying for major 
          promotion events in UK. Our customers are mainly screen printers as well as embroiders.
           Based in London the company has been stocking wholesale plain t-shirts in more than 16 colours. 
           Our custom made service allows or caters for those tee colours which are not being offered from
            stock. If you have a tee colour and want us to offer that as part of our wholesale
             plain t-shirt service then 
          contact us and we can manufacture that specific colour for you.</p>
