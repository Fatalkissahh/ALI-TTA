    <h1>The Bruce Lee Foundation</h1>
    
    Through a number of educational and social initiatives, 
    the Bruce Lee Foundation encourages people to strive for honest self-expression in 
    alignment with their mind, body, and spirit and in harmony with one another.

Since 2002, the Bruce Lee Foundation has created online and physical exhibits to educate people about Bruce Lee, provided financial assistance to students and families within the United States to attend college, provided martial arts instruction for underprivileged youth, and created and run our Camp 
Bruce Lee summer program for kids to encounter Bruce Lee's mind, body and spirit practices.
