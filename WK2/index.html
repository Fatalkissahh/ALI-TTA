        <h1>Movies 1972-73</h1>
        <p>Lee played his first leading role in The Big Boss (1971), which proved to be an enormous box office success 
            across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with Fist of Fury (1972),
             which broke the box office records set previously by The Big Boss. Having finished his initial two-year contract, 
             Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, Concord Production Inc., with Chow. 
             For his third film, Way of the Dragon (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, 
             director, star, and choreographer of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in Long Beach, California, 
             Lee met karate champion Chuck Norris. In Way of the Dragon Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent, 
             their showdown has been characterized as "one of the best fight scenes in martial arts and film history". 
             The role had originally been offered to American karate champion Joe Lewis. 
             Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon went on to gross an estimated US$100 million and US$130 million worldwide, respectively.

            <div>August to October 1972, Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest film Game of Death. 
                He began filming some scenes, including his fight sequence with 7 ft 2 in (218 cm) American basketball star 
                Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former student. Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Brothers offered Lee 
                the opportunity to star in Enter the Dragon, the first film to be produced jointly by Concord, Golden Harvest, 
                and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in February 1973 and was completed in April 1973. However,
                 only a few months after the completion of Enter the Dragon, and six days before its July 26, 1973, release, Lee died. 
                 Enter the Dragon would go on to become one of the year's highest-grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend.
                  It was made for US$850,000 in 1973 (equivalent to $4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007). 
                  Enter the Dragon went on to gross an estimated $350 million worldwide.</div>
